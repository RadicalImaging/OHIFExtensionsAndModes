# Hanging Protocol Mode
The hanging protocol mode adds a number of hanging protocols to better display some studies, mostly as a demonstration
of the capabilities of hanging protocols.  These protocols are NOT intended for clinical use, in particular, the MG
layout is extremely basic and fails to do some of the required hanging of the studies, and is insufficient for real usage.

## Description 
The hanging protocol extension defines hanging protocols for a general 2x2 and 2x1 mode, as well as
a layout for MR heart images and a very basic layout for screening MG images.  This allows demonstrating a 
variety of features of hanging protocols:

* Matching display set information as part of the decision to apply the HP
* Matching more than one display set from a single series
* Applying initial image display offsets
* Edge aligning some images (MG image edge alignment - not quite chest wall alignment)
